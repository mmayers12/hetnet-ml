# Broken Demos

This folder contains ipython notebooks that compare results of feature extraction
via hetnet-ml to those by neo4j further down the learn pipline of rephetio.

These notebooks are broken, as in they will not run due to missing files. They are 
here purely for demonstrative purposes.

## Nomenclature

I had not decided on DWPC and DWWC a termonology for features when producing these results
so `with-replacment` refers to DWWC, and `no-replacment-interpolated` refers to DWPC as
calculated by the extractor module.

`orig` refers to the DWPC features as extracted in the repository [learn]('https://github.com/dhimmel/learn').
